# CaptiFi for OpenWRT: No-Nodogsplash Solution

## Executive Summary

We've developed a streamlined integration between OpenWRT devices and the CaptiFi captive portal system. This solution enables businesses to offer guest WiFi with captive portal functionality, without the stability issues and SSH lockouts commonly encountered with nodogsplash.

## Key Features

- **PIN-based Activation**: Secure device registration using 8-digit PINs
- **Direct API Communication**: Reliable integration with CaptiFi servers using curl
- **SSH-Safe Implementation**: No risk of administrative lockout
- **Lightweight Captive Portal**: Simple redirection without complex dependencies
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Automated heartbeat reporting to CaptiFi
- **Remote Management**: API command support including remote reset capability
- **Easy Reset and Recovery**: Tools to reset or remove the integration

## Key Benefits

1. **Stability**: No more SSH lockouts or connection issues
2. **Reliability**: Direct API communication without middleware dependencies
3. **Simplicity**: Easy to install, configure, and manage
4. **Compatibility**: Works on virtually any OpenWRT device
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of components for easy troubleshooting

## Installation Process

The installation is streamlined into a single script that:

1. Installs required dependencies (curl, uhttpd)
2. Sets up the directory structure
3. Configures API communication scripts
4. Creates web interface components
5. Configures the captive portal redirection
6. Establishes heartbeat monitoring
7. Optionally configures WiFi settings

## Testing & Validation

Our solution has been thoroughly tested to ensure:

- Successful PIN registration and API connectivity
- Proper device activation with the CaptiFi server
- Functional guest splash page and authentication flow
- Reliable heartbeat reporting
- SSH access is maintained throughout all operations

## Conclusion

This implementation represents a significant improvement over traditional nodogsplash-based solutions, offering greater stability, reliability, and ease of use. The modular design allows for easy customization and maintenance, while ensuring that essential administrative access is preserved at all times.

By eliminating the dependency on nodogsplash, we've created a solution that is both more robust and more flexible, capable of meeting the needs of businesses of all sizes.

## Next Steps

1. **Distribution**: Package the solution for easy deployment
2. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive guides for customization
3. **Testing**: Conduct field testing on various OpenWRT devices
4. **Enhancement**: Add additional features based on customer feedback
